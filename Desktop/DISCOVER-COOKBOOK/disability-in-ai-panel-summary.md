# NeurIPS 2019: Disability in AI Panel – Summary & Recommendations

## Overview
At NeurIPS 2019, a 50-minute panel discussion focused on disability inclusion in AI
and how academic conferences can better support disabled participants.
This document summarizes key insights from the panel and presents
actionable recommendations for improving accessibility at AI conferences.

## Key Challenges Discussed
- Lack of permanent physical accessibility features (e.g., stage ramps)
- Overcrowded and noisy poster sessions
- Insufficient consideration of invisible illnesses
- Limited support for cognitive disabilities
- Conference schedules that negatively impact well-being

## Actionable Recommendations

### 1. Physical Accessibility
- Ensure stage ramps are available at all times, not only upon request
- Design venues with step-free access to all session areas
- Provide accessible seating options throughout rooms

### 2. Poster Sessions & Crowd Management
- Offer quieter poster sessions or designated low-noise time slots
- Limit overcrowding by spreading posters across larger spaces
- Allow remote or asynchronous poster viewing options

### 3. Well-being & Scheduling
- Include longer breaks between sessions
- Avoid scheduling high-demand sessions back-to-back
- Provide clearly marked quiet/rest areas

### 4. Invisible & Chronic Illnesses
- Normalize flexible attendance and re-entry policies
- Avoid requiring public disclosure of disabilities for accommodations
- Communicate accommodation options clearly before the event

### 5. Cognitive Disabilities & Neurodiversity
- Share session materials in advance
- Encourage speakers to use clear slides and plain language
- Reduce reliance on flashing visuals or overwhelming animations

## Suggested Conference Accessibility Checklist
- ☐ Permanent physical accessibility features
- ☐ Quiet spaces and low-sensory session options
- ☐ Clear accommodation request process
- ☐ Advance access to conference materials
- ☐ Flexible participation options (remote or asynchronous)
